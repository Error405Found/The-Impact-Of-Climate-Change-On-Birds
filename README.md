# The Impact Of Climate Change On Birds

# Project Description

Climate is changing around the world. This change is impacting species of wild animals. In this project, we will use four decades of bird sightings and climate data to predict the distribution of a bird species in the Scottish Highlands and see how its distribution changed over the years.

This project assumes familiarity with the topics covered in the coursework, Working with Data in the tidyverse, Intermediate Functional Programming with purrr, and the fundamentals of Working with Geospatial Data in R.

I used data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and a subset of the UKCP09 climate data from the UK Met Office.
